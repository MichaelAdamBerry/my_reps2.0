# To Run Locally

You will need to register with Propublica and Google to in order to run this project on your machine locally.

# Next Steps

Future versions will include more a robust biography of each representative and statistics such as voting record, and campaign finance reports.

This project was created with React and Next.js and is mostly a client side application with all data being pulled from Propublica API.
Future versions will look to cache this data in local storage to prevent duplicate API requests as well as building out a simple api for mapping districts ids to member ids.
